## üéØ About The Project

The goal of this project was to move beyond a traditional resume and create an immersive, story-driven experience for visitors. By adopting Apple's design principles‚Äîgenerous white space, bold typography, and high-quality visuals‚Äîthe portfolio focuses on clarity and impact, treating each project as a featured product.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Build a complex, stateful frontend application from scratch using React.
- Implement a modern, responsive UI that provides a great user experience on all devices.
- Use animation libraries to create subtle, professional, and performant animations that enhance the user journey.
